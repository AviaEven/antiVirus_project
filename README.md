# antiVirus_project
The anti-virus project (January 23-February 23) is a project I worked on for pleasure as part of my position at the Cyber Education Center, the project was designed as a mid-year project for my students, I had a lot of fun guiding and even testing this project, while doing a deep analysis, and providing tools for my students.
